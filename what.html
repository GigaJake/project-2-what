			<h1>In a Galaxy, Far Far Away...</h1>
			<p>
				I never thought I'd blow up the Death Star, but then some old guy taught me about the force. I can still hardly believe it, when I first saw that mechanical monstrosity, I thought it was a moon! The Empire has been way out of line lately,
				hopefully you're not some loyalist who needs their mind changed, Old Ben Kenobi taught me how to do that as well. This force stuff is unbelievable, I had no idea the old Jedi knights were so powerful, Vader must be unimaginably strong to take out their whole order.
				All I know is the whole galaxy is safer with the Death Star gone, poor Aldaran is a harrowing example of the Empire's cruelty. I really wish Old Ben was here to see what we accomplished today. First Vader kills my father and now Old Ben? I will stop him, no matter what it takes.
				No amount of awards or recognition from the rebellion can put my life together or bring back home and Uncle Owen. As for what comes next, I don't really know. The Empire will be licking their wounds for a few days, Leia will most likely stay with the rebellion and Hans Solo... well,
				he could be doing anything if the pay is good. Old Ben... or 'Obi-wan' as Vader called him, doesn't feel like he's entirely gone. I know Vader killed him, but it's like he never really left me. I'm not sure what to do in his absense, but I have a feeling my future will take me to Dagobah.
				This is Luke Skywalker, signing off.
